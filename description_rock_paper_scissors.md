## Inspiration
Wanted to learn and practice Python by making something fun and simple.

## What it does
A basic game where you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## How we built it
Used Python, focusing on basic programming concepts like conditions and loops. No special libraries were needed.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to make the computer's choices random and fair was tricky at first.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the game to work smoothly and learning more about Python in the process.

## What we learned
Improved understanding of Python basics and problem-solving in coding.

## What's next for Rock, Paper, Scissors
Maybe adding a scoring system or making a version where two players can play against each other.
